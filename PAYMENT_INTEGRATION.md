# Razorpay Payment Integration - Quick Start

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Backend Setup:**
   - ✅ Installed Razorpay NPM package
   - ✅ Created `/api/payments` routes with 4 endpoints:
     - `POST /api/payments/create-order` - Creates Razorpay order
     - `POST /api/payments/verify-payment` - Verifies payment signature
     - `GET /api/payments/payment/:id` - Fetches payment details
     - `POST /api/payments/refund` - Processes refunds
   - ✅ Added authentication middleware to all payment routes
   - ✅ Integrated with existing booking system

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - ✅ Updated CheckoutModal to use Razorpay instead of mock payment
   - ✅ Added Razorpay SDK loading
   - ✅ Integrated payment flow with booking creation
   - ✅ Added payment verification before booking confirmation
   - ✅ Updated API client with payment methods

3. **Security:**
   - ✅ Payment signature verification on backend
   - ✅ User authentication required for all payment operations
   - ✅ API keys stored in environment variables
   - ✅ Amount verification server-side
